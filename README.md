Problem Statement:

Based on the governmentâ€™s research, over 20% of females in Victoria reported that they experienced gender inequality issues in 2018, and the gender gap shows no sign of closing. This poses a limitation of providing help to the women who are experiencing gender inequality issue, as well as understanding gender equality in a comprehensive manner. Our project is dedicated to create an all-in-one solution to provide support for Victorian women who have experienced different context of gender inequality, as well as educate users about gender equality with hopes that it might actually close the gender gap.
